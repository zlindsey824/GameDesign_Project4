Project description: This project we need to add sprites to our framwork and change GoF singletons to meyers singletons,
framework should conform to item #11 in Modern and Rule of 3/Zero. The main point to this framework is we 
need to understand how polymorphism work in C++. We need to understand the how to use gimp to make picture, and give instance
to use into framwork.

where did I get my sprites, including background: https://www.gameart2d.com/   https://craftpix.net/ 
http://spritedatabase.net/

What is the theme of my animation: sky bird shooting balloon

Did I make a polymorphic vector:  Yes or No  //Yes

What do I like better: GoF Singleton or Meyer's Singleton? //Meyer's Singleton

The easiest part of this project: Use gimp to edit picture and fit to the framwork and call the getinstance to the picture.

Problems that I had in completing this project: two-way-sprite.h and two-way-sprite.cpp. I find it hard to implement and algorthm. however, Dr.Malloy explain do this image flip during in class. so I findout how to do it after that.
